# Random Coordinates Generator :)
Used To Generate Random Coordinates. Could Be Cool To Use If You Want To Go On Vacation But Don't Know Where To Go

# To Do
* Make it where when you hit run, you will get a link to Google Maps showing you where your coordinates are
* Remove all coordinates so you don't get any water (Maybe not possible idk)
